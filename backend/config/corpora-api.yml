        An authenticated user can upload a file from a shared link to a dataset in their collection.

        If the upload is in an error state, this endpoint can be used with the dataset_id to restart the collection.
        If a new link is provided, the new link will be used. If the collection is not in an error state, this endpoint
        will return an error.
